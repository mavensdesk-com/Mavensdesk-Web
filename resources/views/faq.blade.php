          <h4>How Long Does It Take To Create A Website?</h4>
          <p>The length of time it takes to create a fully functional website is based on several factors.
          Custom design work can take anywhere from 1 - 4 weeks, depending on the complexity of the design
          and the number of revisions you require. The development phase requires an additional 1 - 6 weeks,
          depending on the number of pages, and the functionality required. Of course, these are general guidelines,
          and we will make every effort to meet the timeframe you have in mind.</p>
